# DevOps K8s Sandbox Project

This project is designed to easily manage and deploy an EKS cluster and VPC infrastructure on AWS using Terraform. The project supports multiple environments such as `dev` and `prod`.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have the following installed:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- An AWS account with proper permissions to create VPC, S3, DynamoDB, and EKS resources.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Each developer should set up a separate environment directory under the `env/` folder. Follow these steps to get started:

### Step 1: Create Your Environment Directory

1. Inside the `env/` folder, create a directory named after your environment (e.g., `dev` or `prod`).
2. Copy the `dev.tfvars` or `prod.tfvars` into your new environment folder and modify it as needed for your environment.

Example:

```bash
mkdir env/my-env
cp dev.tfvars env/my-env/my-env.tfvars
```

### Step 2: Create S3 Bucket and DynamoDB Table
Terraform requires an S3 bucket to store the state and a DynamoDB table to handle state locking.

Create S3 Bucket: Replace <bucket-name> with your desired bucket name.
```bash
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket <bucket-name> --region us-east-1
```

Create DynamoDB Table: Replace <table-name> with your desired table name.
```bash

aws dynamodb create-table \
  --table-name <table-name> \
  --attribute-definitions AttributeName=LockID,AttributeType=S \
  --key-schema AttributeName=LockID,KeyType=HASH \
  --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=5,WriteCapacityUnits=5
```

You can use the same DynamoDB table across multiple environments.


### Step 3: Configure backend.tfvars

In your environment directory (e.g., env/my-env/), create a my-env-backend.tfvars file with the following content:
```bash
bucket         = "<your-s3-bucket-name>"
key            = "terraform/my-env/terraform.tfstate"
region         = "us-east-1"
dynamodb_table = "<your-dynamodb-table-name>"
```

Replace <your-s3-bucket-name> and <your-dynamodb-table-name> with the actual names you created in Step 2.

### Step 4: Initialize Terraform
Run the following command to initialize Terraform with your environment's specific configuration:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh my-env init
```

### Step 5: Run Terraform Commands
Now you can run Terraform commands for your environment.

Plan: Preview the changes Terraform will make:
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh my-env plan
```

Apply: Apply the changes and deploy the infrastructure:
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh my-env apply
```

Destroy: Destroy the infrastructure when you're done:
```bash
./scripts/destroy.sh my-env
```

```


# Important Notes

Each environment has its own S3 bucket for storing the state file and DynamoDB table for state locking.
Always use the correct environment configuration (<env-name>.tfvars) and backend configuration (<env-name>-backend.tfvars) when running Terraform commands.

# Cleanup

When you are done working with your environment, you can clean up the resources by running the destroy.sh script:
```bash
./scripts/destroy.sh my-env
```

This will destroy all AWS resources created by Terraform.

# Troubleshooting

Ensure that your AWS credentials are properly configured with the AWS CLI.
If you encounter errors related to state locking, you can manually unlock the state using:
```bash
terraform force-unlock <lock-id>
```

if the backend configuration isn't initialized properly, ensure that your backend.tfvars file is correctly configured.
